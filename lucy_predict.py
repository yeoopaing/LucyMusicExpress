Lucy message processing using a usenet question model classifier
Uses the classification model trained on the usenet questions to classify sentences.

This sample illustrates how to use the API to get messages received and send a reply to the sender for a chapter you created.

First thing to do:
    You need to first create an account at https:/www.a.kopo.com/wp/mes
    Next, create a journey using the designer. Click designer after login and add a journey.
    Next, create a chapter for the journey. In the chapter list, click the option icon (top-left in the table) and tick the id.
        Get the id of the chapter. This is the chapter_id you need.

How to use this code:
    Option 1 using Pycharm:
        Just copy this file to your Pycharm project folder and you willl see lucybot.py file under your project.
        Change username, passwd, and chapter_id below.
        Shift-Ctr-F10 to start to process your chapter messages.
        To stop your script on Pycharm, click on the stop button on the right of the Run console.
        Monitor any errors
        Modify the code to make it more interesting

    Option 2 using any text editor:
        Change username, passwd, and chapter_id below.
        Suppose you have install Pyhton 2.7 in C:/python27
        You can run this code directly using command line:
            C:\python27\python lucybot.py
        To stop your script, press Ctrl-C
